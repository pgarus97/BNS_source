Ocarina of Time, new PBs in not one but two categories. 
Kegan any% SRM sub 10 (9:05). credit warp from first area, requires precise memory manipulation, thanks to oot normalized movement doable, ESS Adapter setup at the end. 
Bubzia Defeat Ganon, 2nd place by 7 seconds with a 35:42, learned new optimizations from saver, submitted to RTAinJapan. speedrun on learning, only 2 weeks 

Nintedo Switch Sports by Saver, managed to beat all main categories / difficulties (Normal 14:56 Strong Powerhouse 31:18), 6 main sports: Volleyball,Badminton,Bowling,Soccer, Chambara, Tennis 
blindfolded motion controls, + reaction time + lots of RNG. Especially difficult Tennis in Powerhouse and I believe Soccer in Normal.

Duck Life 1 by Creepiumgamer any% NMG 27:09, very interesting web game on PC, goal is to train your duck and win races, for blindfolded, creepiumgamer noticed that you level up your duck even if you fail trainings,
beginning of the run is maxing out all the stats by repeatedly loosing the training and then clear all the races super fast.

Alttp by Cerpin, managed to complete 3 categories, new WR in the super optimized any% 2:56 beating katun by 2 seconds, includes a glitch that dissappears when you get hit, RNG and careful execution
cucco easter egg and armos (first boss). Both of these runs also use major glitches and are somewhat a preparation for a longer run Cerpin is working on. I was also told that he wants to try some other
blindfolded projects outside of ALTTP as well this year!

SM64
it finally happened: the world first blindfolded 120 run that I worked on for so long! 11:22:43
