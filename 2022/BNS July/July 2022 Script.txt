First, we have a run of Spyro 1 from the Reignited Triology by goosehero! This run covers basically the first world of Spyro 1
an involves a pretty cool skip, the fairy proxy skip. goosehero found a pretty good set up including a sound cue to know if it was performed correctly or not. From there it can be retried if needed.
Goosehero also thinks a full game run would theoretically be possible, and a group of runners is actually currently figuring out strats for a "Neo Vortex" run.
